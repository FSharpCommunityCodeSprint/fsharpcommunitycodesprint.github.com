On small glitch is that Google's place is already booked that date !

Please watch in here or on the [open source f# google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!forum/fsharp-opensource) for updates on the place.


We are learning and asked if they can supply a updated calendar in the future.
Meanwhile we are looking for a place for around 5-10 people (the first sprint will be limited but everyone is welcome) ideally halfway between Padington and Kings Cross, in order to accomodate for all. **Suggestion/Booking welcome !**
