## What is the next sprint about ?

You can vote for what the next sprint will work on the [Doodle survey](http://doodle.com/tqc9k54z4spvyb42)

As of now, we have 3 project we could work on :

* The Open Source Editor integration / [which is here](https://github.com/fsharp/fsharpbinding) and which was recently enhanced to support Emacs
* Tomas's FSharp.Formatting / [which is here](http://tpetricek.github.com/FSharp.Formatting/demo.html)
* [Fsharpx](https://github.com/fsharp/fsharpx/issues) has some issues that can be worked onm and probably some other that can be documented

And you can submit your ideas as well.

So which one will it be ? Which one is the best to be polished/manipulated ?


## When will it be ?

You can write your availability on the [Doodle time survey](http://doodle.com/46w8dgq2vaq8a8un)
Put all the time that fits for you, then we'll try to maximize whatever suits best for all
