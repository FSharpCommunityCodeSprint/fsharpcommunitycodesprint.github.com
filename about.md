## Where ?


The [Rapid Innovation Group](http://www.rapidinnovation.co.uk/) have kindly offered to let us use their offices in Holborn, which is easily accessible from around London, as well as from Cambridge, Oxford, and other unrecommendable places.


## When ?

We'll send a Doodle to determine the best time for everyone around 3 weeks before the planned period.
Two weeks before, the date will be chosen.


## How ?

We'll take a library, and just work on adding small improvements
Hopefully the diverse set of skills of everyone involved will help the original author and the community at large


## What should I do before the sprint ?

For every sprint :

* Make sure you have a [github account](https://github.com/signup/free), (you might want to set it up further by reading their advices [here](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git) and [there](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys)
* Read [a little about git](http://learn.github.com/p/intro.html) 
* Read about the [recommended stack](stack.html)
* Read about the project, may be try to set it up and work through example

The more you prepare, the more the group will be efficient. 
But if you have difficulties, do not worry : that is precisely because never everything is straightforward that those meetings are fruitful.
So, do your homework, but otherwise don't bother if not everything is perfect.




## Can you describe the organization and how I can help ?

As this is a first to me, this will probably evolve, but we should issue better instruction in the future.

In the meantime, if you have anything to mention that you saw was useful in those kind of events, please do not hesitate to make it known.
Feedback loop is crucial !

Ideally, some people will be assigned a role :

- the flying matchmaker
- the system guy to iron out petty problems
- a role dedicated at 'incorporating' as fast as possible new joiners of the project for the course of the sprint
